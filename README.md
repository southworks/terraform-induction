Example source code from terraform.

* **terraform demo:** example of a basic infrastructure in Azure with a pipeline to automatically deploy upon each change.

* **deploy project:** example of a script to create a project in devops with an empty repository, a pipeline and a repository on github.

In both cases, it will be necessary to enter the service's own settings (names, access tokens, etc.)
